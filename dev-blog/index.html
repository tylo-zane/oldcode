     This is the Dev Blog for my game, Ephemeralness. It has a navigation bar which gives
     access to an "About" and a "Progress" page.

      <p>It's the social venue for Apathy and his pals, the Velvet Bar. Meet with
      friends to discover their true nature (and upgrade abilities)! There's even a
      bartender who has yet to be implemented into the code. She had to be somewhere
      tonight.</p>

      <p>Art is a common byproduct of working on videogames. I've decided to (eventually) add
      this drawing into the game. Until then, it's uploaded here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

      <p>This is a long awaited update for the residents of Ikari; finally, public
      transportation! The International Bus Stop is a new interface which allows the player
      to travel between worlds. So far, it only reaches two places, but the vessel will
      eventually grant access to dungeons.</p>

      <p>Welcome to the Ikari Pelago, homeworld of our protagonists. Ikari is a group of
      floating islands that broke off from Earth about a century ago. Now, in the
      year 21XX, strange creatures have inhabited these lands. With the questionable
      goddess Divinity at their lead, will Ikari be thrown into political
      peril?</p>
