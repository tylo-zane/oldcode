      <h1>About the Project</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>"Ephemeralness" is my first ambitious game creation. I've never felt quite an
      affinity for a personal project before. This is ironic considering
      the six main characters of this game are personas
      of things which "I've always had problems with". There's Apathy, Vanity, Divinity,
      Fortune, and Sin. By creating characters based on my
      grievances, I hoped to face some issues head-on and perhaps learn something.</p>
      <p>The basic premise in Ephemeralness goes something like this: You play as Apathy, an
      artful but unmotivated student who struggles with meeting the university's
      standards. One day, Apathy is summoned by the Goddess as a "chosen one" of sorts
      (He is really being exploited for labor). It turns out there's a killer in Ikari,
      and you must explore the minds of suspects to determine a culprit.</p>
      <p>You'll just have to believe me that a goddess has the power to look through minds.</p>
      <p>Remember, screenshots are a work in progress.</p>
