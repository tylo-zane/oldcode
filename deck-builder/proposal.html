         <h2>The Issue</h2>
         <p>
         The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game">Pokémon
         Trading Card Game</a> is a collectible card game centered around Nintendo's Pokémon
         franchise. It was first released to Japanese territories in 1996. In late 1998,
         the game made its way overseas thanks to American publisher Wizards of the Coast
         (best known for their cult hit, Magic: The Gathering).  While the initial release
         of the Pokémon TCG contained a mere 102 cards, throughout the years, many expansion
         sets have been implemented. As of 2019, there is a total of 11,000 unique Pokémon cards.
         A single deck consists of 60 cards which players must then pit against each other in
         strategic battles.
         </p>
         <p>
         An important element to winning the card game is to build strong decks which allow for
         strategization. In order to do so, players must search for the specific cards that will
         best suit their playstyle. Unfortunately, the art of deck building is plagued by
         unnecessary complications. No easy method exists of exploring the game’s vast log of
         cards while grouping them together as potential decks. Furthermore, players lack a
         method of quickly sharing their decks with one another.
         </p>
         <p>
         An API exists containing data on every English Pokémon card. Players can
         <a href="https://pokemontcg.io/">search this API</a>
         for the cards they wish to obtain. However, the site does not allow for users to group
         together sets of 60 cards as “decks”. Instead, the user must save each image file to a
         folder on their computer. Moreover, there is no efficient method for players to share their
         deck lineups with one another. Taking a picture of physical cards reduces readability,
         and simply writing a list of names poses a problem, as many cards exist with the same name.
         </p>

         <h2>The Solution</h2>
         <p>
         All players of the TCG would benefit immensely from a deck building app, as it would
         allow for faster building and sharing of decks than ever before. A user simply searches
         searches for the name or type of card he desires. With a click, said card is added to a new,
         virtual collection. The user provides a name and ultimately decides what this
         collection represents; it could be a deck, or simply a list meant for later viewing.
         If the user creates an account with the site, they may save as many decks as they’d
         like to its server. Finally, decks could be sent to other users by use of an export
         feature, which generates a shareable link.
         </p>
         <p>
         An additional application which could facilitate deck sharing is a dedicated social
         gallery. Users could upload the decks they create for their friends to
         see. Certain decks (like the ones of professional players) may become featured.
         A feed and comment system would be implemented to make the app feel more like a community.
         </p>
         <p>
         With the introduction of a deck building app, players no longer need to take the time to search
         for and record all sixty cards they wish to add to their deck. The process of deck building
         is streamlined by having every step take place on a single site. Furthemore, the process
         of deck sharing is facilitated by allowing visual representations of decks to be sent
         to one another without need for a camera.

         <h3>Deck Sharing Walkthrough</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>
            The user is greeted to a screen displaying all the decks he's created.
            He clicks on the hamburger menu next to his first deck, revealing a
            dropdown with options of "Edit deck", "Edit privacy", and "Delete".
            </li>
            <li>
