			<h4>As of October 2</h4>
			<p>A good amount of the script has been written, and there's a handful of locations
			to visit. You can talk to one NPC, but she just babbles recycled lines from a Sonic
			fan game. There's a pause menu. The camera even moves! However, a lot still needs
			to be done. This includes approximately five dungeons to fight through.
