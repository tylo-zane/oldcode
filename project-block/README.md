# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://project-block-11.firebaseapp.com/>

The site is called Block and was bootstrapped with Create React App. It is a website that runs a choose your own adventure game for people that have artist's block or for people that just want to have fun. 

With the help of firebase, the user is also able to register an account, then create and save their own story. Users will be able to select from others' stories and play them as well.

To play the game, either select quick play or select a story to play. Then go through the story and make decisions that make sense to you! When you reach the end of the story you will be given a palette that hopefully provides a bit of inspiration.
