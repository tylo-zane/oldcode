# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://info340a-wi19.github.io/project-yourusername/>

The site is called Block. It is a website that runs a choose your own adventure game for people that have artist's block or people that just want to have fun. 
When finished with the story, the user will get a prompt for them to draw and a palette of colors to draw the prompt with, in the hopes that the user gets a little inspiration.
