	    	<h2>Proposed Application</h2>
	    	<p>
	    		A potential app that could attempt to alleviate the creative block on users is a website that allows users to post ideas, get help from a community, use a random plot/idea/character generator, or play a game. All features would be built with the purpose to help the user get over their creative block or it can act as a place where the user can spend time there when they need to rest from creating. 
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	    		Potential users for this app are professional or amateur writers and artists. This could even be used by students that need to write papers. What the users will be able to do on the website is read and post to public forum, rest and play a text game in order for them to get ideas, and use the random generators to get random characters, plots, plot twists, and names.
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	    		This website would be a possible solution as it targets the suspected cause of creative blocks, which is a lack of imagination or creativity, overworking, or something else. by providing a place for users to spend their time recuperating.
