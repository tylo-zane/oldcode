Hello, my name is Tyler Marcinyshyn! I'm an intended Informatics major at the University of Washington, where I study web & interaction design. I pride myself on emphasizing visual charm without need for sacrificing the qualities of inclusive design.

On my portfolio, you'll find the following three projects:

### 1. Conversation Parade
### 2. Pok√©mon Deck Builder
### 3. Project Block
