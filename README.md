Hello, my name is Tyler Marcinyshyn! I'm an intended Informatics major at the University of Washington, where I study web & interaction design. I pride myself on emphasizing visual charm without need for sacrificing the qualities of inclusive design.

You will find the following three projects on my portfolio:

### 1. Conversation Parade
Conversation Parade is an experimental game allowing you to engage in discussions with Apathy, the cartoon cat. He will respond in different manners depending on the text you input. Using the 'emote' buttons in the lower right corner, you can even communicate how Apathy makes you feel. Originally created for CSE 154 as an exercise in PHP programming. 

### 2. Pokémon Deck Builder
The Pokémon Deck Builder lets you search a complete API database of Pokémon Trading Cards to discover the perfect 'Mon for your dream deck. You can move cards to and from your virtual deck simply by clicking upon them

### 3. Project Block
Block is a choose-your-own adventure game with the goal of helping artists work through their creator's block. Using the account creation services provided by Firebase, users can register with the site and create their very own stories for others to play. Completion of a story awards the player with a prompt and color palette to assist them in creating art.
